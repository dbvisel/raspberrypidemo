# raspberry pi demos

These are demo files for using with a Raspberry Pi connected to simple electrical components:

 * *lights.py* contains basic code for turning on and off five LEDs and a buzzer.
 * *ledmatrix.py* contains basic code for using an LED matrix. This only works in Python 2.
 * *ledmatrix4.py* contains basic code for using an array of 4 LED matrices. This only works in Python 2.

This code is dependent on the wiring being the same as it is in the setup I've used. The photos can be used as a reference if the wires come loose. The Fritizing diagram (in */layouts*) contains the schematic and board layout.
